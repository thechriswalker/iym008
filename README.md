# IYM008 - Advanced Cryptography 2019-2020

This repo is just a holding ground for code I have written to implement various
cryptographic algorithms.

**DO NOT USE THESE FOR REAL WORLD APPLICATIONS**

Crazy, I even need to write that. They are published here as they are likely very
naive and simplistic implementations so could be useful for learning.

However after implementin DES from the specification, it turns out that I have used
such bad methods of performing the various operations that it likely isn't even a
particularly good learning resource.

OTOH, for the DES example, the Go standard library has an excellent and well written
implementation which (if you know the spec) is actually quite readable.
It can be browsed online at: https://golang.org/src/crypto/des/
